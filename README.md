## Decentralized Medicine Selling System

project is a Decentralized Medicine Selling System built using Hyperledger Fabric. The main objective of this project is to ensure transparency, traceability, and trust in the pharmaceutical supply chain by using blockchain technology.

In this system, different participants such as manufacturers, dealer and shop interact on a secure and permissioned network. Each transaction—from manufacturing to selling—is recorded immutably on the blockchain, ensuring that medicines cannot be tampered with or counterfeited during the supply chain process.

This project includes smart contracts (chaincode) written in Go to manage medicine data.
